This is  a sample validation logic for sudoku

The program generates a 9x9 sudoku board with random numbers
Then checks the sudoku for correctness

Most of the times the Sudoku should be invalid because of the way the random numbers are generated so the program returns false

Next steps:
1. Add a sudoku generation logic
2. Update code to accept sudoku board as input  and validate it
3. Solve sudoku given an incomplete board

Future enhancements:
1. Add a gui
2. Enable n x n sudoku validation
